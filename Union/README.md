C Unions
--------------

The Union is a user-defined data type in C language that can contain elements of the different data types just like structure. But unlike structures, all the members in the C union are stored in the same memory location. Due to this, only one member can store data at the given instance.

Syntax of Union in C ::

The syntax of the union in C can be divided into three steps which are as follows:

C Union Declaration
-----------------------
In this part, we only declare the template of the union, i.e., we only declare the membersâ€™ names and data types along with the name of the union. No memory is allocated to the union in the declaration.

union union_name {
    datatype member1;
    datatype member2;
    ...
};

Different Ways to Define a Union Variable
----------------------------------------------
We need to define a variable of the union type to start using union members. There are two methods using which we can define a union variable.

1. With Union Declaration
2. After Union Declaration

1. Defining Union Variable with Declaration
union union_name {
    datatype member1;
    datatype member2;
    ...
} var1, var2, ...;
2. Defining Union Variable after Declaration
union union_name var1, var2, var3...;


Size of Union
--------------------------
The size of the union will always be equal to the size of the largest member of the array. All the less-sized elements can store the data in the same space without any overflow.


Q&A
--------

**1. Can we store data in multiple union members at the same time?**
--------------------------------------------------------------
No. We can only store data in a single member at the same time. For example in the following C program, both x and y share the same location. If we change x, we can see the changes being reflected in y. 


// C program to check if we can store data in multiple union
// members
#include <stdio.h>
 
// Declaration of union is same as structures
union test {
    int x, y;
};
 
int main()
{
    // A union variable t
    union test t;
 
    t.x = 2; // t.y also gets value 2
    printf("After making x = 2:\n x = %d, y = %d\n\n", t.x,
           t.y);
 
    t.y = 10; // t.x is also updated to 10
    printf("After making y = 10:\n x = %d, y = %d\n\n", t.x,
           t.y);
    return 0;
}

**Output::**

After making x = 2:
 x = 2, y = 2

After making y = 10:
 x = 10, y = 10


**2. What are the applications of unions?**
-----------------------------------------
Unions can be useful in many situations where we want to use the same memory for two or more members. For example, suppose we want to implement a binary tree data structure where each leaf node has a double data value, while each internal node has pointers to two children, but no data.
